    <h4> Justification</h4>
    <p>
      I changed the letter spacing to .05em and the font kerning for paragraphs to normal according to Butterick's summary of key rules. I made line spacing 130% and line length always under 95 characters by changing the margins on paragraphs according to Butterick's typography in 10 minutes. I used Sans Serif and Serif for paragraphs and titles, respectively.</p>
      <p>On the page for my transcript, I divided the courses into 3 different sections because most people are looking for specific information if looking at a transcript and do now want to read through a long tedious list. On the full screen the page shows two columns at a time so the user does not have to scroll all the way down, whereas on a tablet or a mobile device the webpage shows only one column at a time so that the lines are not cut too short.</p>
<p>On the page for my projects and skills the images disappear when the screen becomes too small because the content on the projects and my skill is more important than the pictures to the side, and I had to choose something to go in the graceful degradation approach I chose.</p>
<p>The projects page also has links to PDFs of the papers I have written incase the user would like more information, and the PDFs open a new tab rather than taking over the current page simply because losing the page you are on becomes quite frustrating.</p>
<p>The navigation bar changes its orientation to vertical rather than horizontal on tablets and mobile devices according to Krug’s rules in Don’t Make Me Think. This makes it easier to see all the options without having them too squished on smaller screens. In addition to this, the navigation bar highlights the tab for the corresponding page the user is on as Krug also mentions is good design in his book.</p>
<p>Though it is commonly known that most websites should not have more than two navigation bars, unless they are an extremely large website with many different pages, I chose to put a navigation link at the bottom on the web page which can bring the user back to the home page. I decided to do this specifically for my Projects page. This is a longer page and after scrolling all the way to the bottom, I wanted the user to be able to navigate easily back to the home page rather than having to scroll all the way back up.</p>
<p>I chose the fading background to make my site more unique and set it apart. This does not distract the user or affect the web site in any other way then just making it a little more interesting and fun to look at. I also made the background of the main a light grey to avoid a harsh white background and to make it easier on the user’s eyes while still setting it apart from other sections on the web page.</p>
<p>I decided to make all the borders curved to make it more visually appealing and softer, while still maintaining repetition on my design choices. I used only a few different colors throughout the site and used them consistently for the same thing. For example, I used purple for the title before paragraphs or sections throughout the main.</p>
<p>I kept my site as simple as possible, making sure that I didn’t have any extra pages or pictures or transitions or dectorations which where helpful or necessary for the main content of my website. I tried to follow the rules of KISS (keep it simple) as much as possible. My goal for this web site was for users to find information on me and my previous research and courses taken quickly and efficiently, and keeping this site simple and small allows for users to do this easily.</p>
