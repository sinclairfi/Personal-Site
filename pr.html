    <h4>On Cops and Robbers</h4>
      <p>A math paper with Dr. Ryan Higginbottom and Cheryl Fergerson for my junior math talk on graph theory, specifically hunting robbers on a chess board</p>
      <h5>Abstract:</h5>
      <p>Cops and robber graphs put a fun and game-like spin on graph theory while still providing a real life application. The idea is to have two players, one playing the cops and the other the robber. The goal for the cops is to catch the robber and the goal for the robber is to not get caught. We present some theorems, lemmas, examples, and applications to chess in the perusal of this topic.</P>

      <h4>On Magic Squares</h4>
      <p>A math paper with Dr. Roman Wong, for my Senior Math talk on magic squares and their properties and dimensions.</p>
      <h5>Abstract:</h5>
      <p>Let n ∈  N.  Let A=[a<sub>ij</sub>] be a n x n matrix.  Let Sn be the set of all permutations of {1,2,3,…,n}.  Let a transversal of A is defined as</p> <p id="center">T={a<sub>1</sub>σ(1), a<sub>2</sub>σ(2), …, a<sub>n</sub>σ(n)}</p>  <p>Thus a transversal is a set of n elements of A such that no two of them can lie in the same row or column. The sum of the transversal is</p>
      <p id="center">S(T)= a<sub>1</sub>σ(1)+a<sub>2</sub>σ(2)+…+a<sub>n</sub>σ(n).</p>
      <p>The matrix A is called a constant transversal matrix if S(T) is constant for every σ∈ Sn.  Let V<sub>n</sub> be the set of all n x n constant transversal matrices. We investigate some properties of V<sub>n</sub> and show that it is a subspace of M<sub>nxn</sub> and has dimension 2n-1.   We also show a magic trick using the property of V<sub>n</sub>.</p>

  <h4>Linear Algebra & Graph theory</h4>
  <p>A paper with Cheryl Fergerson on the union of Linear Algebra and Graph Theory</p>
  <h5>Abstract:</h5>
  <p>This paper goes over finding walks and paths between different vertices using the determinants of their adjacency matrices and the number of paths of certain lengths using eigenvalues.</p>

  <h4>Graph Coloring</h4>
  <p>A paper with Cheryl Fergerson on graph coloring.</p>
  <h5>Abstract:</h5>
  <p>The issue of  graph  coloring  applies  to  many  different  areas  and  studies,  and as the graph grows, so does the many different techniques and algorithms used to find solutions to this growing problem.  Applications of graph coloring techniques are often used in timetabling, scheduling, radio frequency assignments, computer register allocations and much more.  Though all of the applications listed seem like they would only come up during a modern era with computers and large sets of data that need complex difficult solutions, there is also a large historical aspect to the concept of  graph  coloring,  specifically  coloring  maps with neighboring countries using only four colors. </p>
  <p>Though it may already be understood, it is important to mention that the goal of a graph coloring problem is to color the vertices a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices are the same color, and in such a way that the number of colors used in the graph is minimized.  This paper will explore the history of the four color problem, algorithms for solving large coloring problems, and will include a closer look at three specific graph coloring algorithms.</p>

<h4>Medical Fee Schedule Calculator:</h4>
<p>A project with Caroline Sinclair for Billing Dynamics.</p>
 <p>We created a program to analyze medical bills automatically and correctly, rather than doing them by hand, saving hours each time a bill had to be reviewed.</p>
 <p>This project was self-procured with no supervisor or manager. I learned how to make realistic work timelines and goals according to what was feasible for the time given, and how to stick to those timelines with no supervision to make sure we were finishing our tasks. I learned the different processes it takes to make a marketable product and how to receive feedback from those using the program and how to make it simple to use for anyone to use.</p>
